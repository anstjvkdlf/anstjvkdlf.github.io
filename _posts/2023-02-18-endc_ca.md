# 1. EN-DC (NSA)

## 1.1. Architecture

NSA is 5G architecture using LTE infrasturcture.

Here, LTE infrastructure meaning is eNB + LTE Core.

**NSA = eNB + gNB + LTE Core**. 

This is all. nothing more than that.

[&uarr; from 3GPP]

If it is complicated, forget about its interfaces in the picture.

## 1.2. Network layer view

ENDC is operating on the PDCP layer.

To distinguish difference between ENDC and CA easily, it is very good to approach in point of view of network layer.

I recommand to memorize that ENDC is working on PDCP layer. Don't have to go deeper.

Remind that LTE and 5G both are using same protocol stack(PDCP - RLC - MAC - PHY)

## 1.3. Operation

Assume NSA UE tries to download something, it can be depicted as below.

And as I told you before, ENDC is operating on PDCP layer.

It tries to split packet at PDCP layer.

After spliting it looks like below.

This is ENDC.

ENDC can use both eNB and gNB utilizing PDCP layer algorithms.

# 2. CA (Carrier Aggregation)

## 2.1. What is CA?

In one sentence,

CA = combining several cells at the same time.

Each cell has its own bandwidth, so the performance is limited.

To improve throughput, in 2013 they introduced technology to comine cells.

## 2.2. Network layer view

ENDC is operating on the MAC layer.

## 1.3. Operation

Assume UE tries to download data with CA on.

MAC layer acts like scheduler distributing packets to the componet carriers(PHYs).

They split its data at the MAC layer.
