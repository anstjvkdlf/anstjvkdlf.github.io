# 1. CA (Carrier Aggregation)

## 1.1. What is CA?

CA = combining several cells at the same time.

Each cell has limited bandwidth, therefore by combining many cells it can meet high QoS.

CA is introduced in 2013(LTE-A).

At 3gpp page, they depicted 3CC CA well.
[&darr; from 3gpp, 3 Cell combined]

There are some terms we need to know first to comprehand CA well.

PCell(primary cell) : As term suggests this is source cell that UE attachs.

SCell(secondary cell) : As term suggests this is the cells that try to aggregate.

If 5G is SA(Stand Alone), there only exist Pcell and Scells. However when it comes to EN-DC the term PsCell is needed. 

PSCell(primary and secondary cells) :
When we say pCell in EN-DC environment, it is confusing if it is eNB Pcell or gNB pcell.
There were needs to distinguish eNB Pcell and gNB Pcell.
Within EN-DC, eNB becomes main Cell. So we promise to say at gNB Pcell as PScell.

sPCell = PCell + PSCell.

## 1.2. Network layer view

CA is operating on the MAC layer.

## 1.3. Operation

Assume UE tries to download data with CA on.

MAC layer acts like scheduler distributing packets to the componet carriers(PHYs).

They split its data at the MAC layer.

# 1.4 CA Bandwidth

There are rules when you try to combine carriers. This rule was fixed by 3gpp (38.104)

| NR CA             | Bandwidth       | NR Band | Channel bandwidth (MHz) |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| configuration     | combination set |         | 5                       | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |
| CA_n25A-n66A-n71A | 0               | n25     | 5                       | 10 | 15 | 20 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |
|                   |                 | n66     | 5                       | 10 | 15 | 20 |    |    |    | 40 |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |
|                   |                 | n71     | 5                       | 10 | 15 | 20 |

For example, when you want to aggregate 3 carriers

Above table is telling you of combination that is allow to aggregate - [n25A, n66A, n71A].

Each band [n25A, n66A, n71A] is parameter that indicates frequency.

Each band's features is well organized at at : https://www.sqimway.com/nr_ca.php#ca_fr1_inter_3

Further more, when you want to combine more than 3 carrieres, there are some more rule of selecting proper nr-arfcn.

You have to choose bandwidth that requires mod3 = 0.
```
For example, DL-arfcn=392500 (X) / DL-arfcn=392520(O))
```

# 1.5 Scell change (SA)

First of all, you need to know the flow of Scell change.

```
gNB                         UE
|                           |
|    RRC Reconfiguration    |
|-------------------------->|
|    RRC Reconf complete    |
|<--------------------------|
|                           |
|    A6 mesurement Report   |
|<--------------------------|
|                           |
```

In RRC Reconfiguration message, there are field called reportConfigToAddModList.

If there are better Scell in your current gNB, RRC Reconfiguration try to
include EventA6 to the reportConfigToAddModList.

Below is Example reportConfigToAddModList message of eventA1, eventA6 is very similar to this structure.
To include Event A6 in reportConfigToAddModList field, gNB compares cells RSRP.
If RSRP is better or same, it includes A6 event.
```
        reportConfigToAddModList {
          {
            reportConfigId 1,
            reportConfig reportConfigEUTRA: {
              triggerType event: {
                eventId eventA1: {
                  a1-Threshold threshold-RSRP: 90
                },
                hysteresis 10,
                timeToTrigger ms320
              },
              triggerQuantity rsrp,
              reportQuantity both,
              maxReportCells 1,
              reportInterval ms120,
              reportAmount r1
            }
```
---

In RRC Reconfiguration there is filed called measIdToAddModList.

measObjectId is connected to cell configuration.

reportConfigId is connected to reportConfigToAddModList.

If we want to change Scell, Scell has to have reportConfigId.
In this case, Cell(measObjectId 1,2) are available to get A1 report from UE.

```
        measIdToAddModList {
          {
            measId 2,
            measObjectId 1,
            reportConfigId 1
          },
          {
            measId 3,
            measObjectId 2,
            reportConfigId 1
          }
```

I was in trouble with including Event A6 in reportConfigToAddModList message,

The solution from my co-worker was that if UE trigger A2 first, which means serving scell too poor to maintain service,

RRC Reconfiguration try to include Event A6 to reportConfigToAddModList trying to change scell.

And then gNB is available to receive A6.
